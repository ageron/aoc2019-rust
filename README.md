Advent of Code 2019 in Rust
===========================

If you've never heard of Advent of Code, you're missing out. Check it out now at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/about)!

I mostly do AoC puzzles for fun, generally coding in Python, but I've also found that it's a great way to get some experience with other programming languages, such as Julia or Rust.

In this repository, I've solved all [AoC 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) puzzles using Rust.

As I'm still learning Rust, the code may not always be as simple or idiomatic as it could be. If you have suggestions of things I could improve, please don't hesitate to file an issue or submit a PR. Thanks!
